title: Hello & Welcome
description: Hi! I'm Chelsea: a gamer, animal lover, writer, environmentalist, reader, and most of all, an artist. I recieved a BFA in Graphic Design at Cal Poly Pomona. I thoroughly enjoy designing logos, branding and illustrations, but my interests are not limited to these. Small details and subtle messages are my strong suit, as I believe all design should not only intrigue the viewer on an intellectual level, but also linger in their minds. Utilizing Adobe programs, pencils, pens, and paper are merely the tools for my art. My skills, abilities, eagerness to learn, and love for creating art provide a pathway to being an original and unforgettable visual communicator.
